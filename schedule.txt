// Day 1 - Musical Interaction and Basic Synthesis Techniques	
Sound and Music Interaction, what is it? Whatâ€™s is current state?
Mapping examples with oscillators, FM synthesis and wavetable synthesis. 

// Day 2 - Music gestures & Microsound
How do we map music gestures?
What is micro sound?
Mapping examples with sample player and granular synthesis. 

// Day 3 Machine Listening & FFT
What is FTT?
What sonic features can we extract from FFT analysis?
How can we use sonic spectral information for interaction?
Mapping examples with fft and the TimbreID library

// Day 4 Spectral processing
How can we use FFT techniques to create new sounds?
Mapping examples with convolution, Phase Vocoder and spectral delay

// Day 5 Spatial Sound
Overview of different multichannel techniques, their characteristics and uses: Ambisonics, VBAP and DBAP.
